BravoJS is an implementation of an unratified proposed draft for CommonJS 
Modules/2.0

The current draft this code is based on is located at 
http://www.page.ca/~wes/CommonJS/modules-2.0-5/commonjs%20modules%202.0-5.pdf

Caveat User: BravoJS is based on an early draft of an unratified CommonJS 
specification. This means that using this product as it stands today will 
most likely lead you to writing modules which are not compatible with any 
other CommonJS platform.
