Welcome to the Fastload plug-in

Copyright (c) 2010 PageMail, Inc.
Released under the terms of the MIT License.

This plug-in alters a CommonJS Modules/2.0 environment to modules
with a simple multi-module transport system.

Many modules may be requested by, and sent to the client at once. 
The server component can identify module dependencies (by examining
module.declare statements) and proactively feed dependencies to
the client.

Client-Side
===========
Simply load the fastload.js script after the CommonJS environment.
This file will override module.provide in your environment, which 
should be used by the underlying module system to load whatever 
modules it needs. You will also need to tell fastload.js where the
server-side component is located.

Example:

<head>
  <script src="/path/to/CommonJSEnvironment.js">
  <script src="/path/to/fastload.js">
  <script>
  fastload_config.server_module = "http://myserver.com/cgi-bin/gpsee_fastload.js";    
  </script>
</head>


Server-Side
===========
Select the server-side component you wish to use, and install it. Here
is a run-down of the various options:

Component		Deps	Minify	Cache	Gzip	CDN
----------------------	------	------	------	------	------	
gpsee_fastload.js	Yes	Yes	Yes	Soon	Soon

Legend
------
Deps:	Can resolve dependencies on the server-side by examining module.declare
Minify:	Can minify JavaScript code before transmitting
Cache:	Can use HTTP-level caching (status 304) to avoid re-transmitting content
Gzip:	Can use gzip to compress JavaScript code before transmitting
CDN:	Supports creation of flat files for roll-out on a dumb server, CDN, etc
